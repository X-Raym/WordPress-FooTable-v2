# WordPress-FooTable-v2
A minimalist FooTable v2 integration for WordPress.

Cannot be hosted on WordPress repo cause it loads FooTable from using CloudFare JavaScript CDN.

Meant to be moded.

No update plan, I coded for a very specific thing, but I may update it if needed, so it can be more flexible for other users.

Currently, there is conditions inside the main php file to prevent resources to be loaded on every page. This is the problem with the official FooTable WordPress integration.
